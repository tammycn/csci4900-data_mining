##Objectives:
The course aims to provide students with a broad introduction to the field of Data Mining and related areas and to teach students how to apply these methods to solve problems in complex domains. The course is appropriate both for students preparing for research in Data Mining and Machine Learning, as well as Bioinformatics, Science and Engineering students who want to apply Data Mining techniques to solve problems in their fields of study.

##Recommended Background:
CSCI 2720 Data Structures. Familiarity with basic computer algorithms and data structures. Familiarity with the Java programming language is recommended but not required.

##Topics to be Covered:
Part I: Data Mining techniques: Selected from: Association and Classification Rule Mining, Linear Models, Decision Trees and Random Forests, Neural Network approaches, Support Vector Machines, Bayesian Learning, Instance-based Learning, Pre-processing and Feature Selection, Performance evaluation, Ensemble Learning and clustering.
Part II: Data Mining applications: Selected from: Bioinformatics, Biomedical/Physical/Chemical modeling, medical diagnosis, text/web mining, pattern recognition and/or other contemporary applications.

##Expected Work:
Reading; assignments (include running experiments using the Weka package); paper presentation, two midterms; and term project (may require programming or running existing packages) and paper. **Unless otherwise announced by the instructor, all assignments and all exams must be done entirely on your own.**

##Academic Honesty and Integrity:
All academic work must meet the standards contained in ["A Culture of Honesty."](http://www.uga.edu/honesty/ahpd/culture_honesty.htm) Students are responsible for informing themselves about those standards before performing any academic work. The penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance is not an acceptable defense.

##Grading Policy:
Assignments: 20% (Programs, homeworks, attendance, paper presentation)  
Midterm Examinations: 40%  
Term Project: 40% (includes term paper and presentation)  
Students may work on their term projects in groups of up to **three** students each. The above distribution is only tentative and may change later. The instructor will announce any changes. 

##Assignment Submission Policy
Assignments must be turned in by the assigned deadline. Late assignments will not be accepted. Rare exceptions may be made by the instructor only under extenuating circumstances and in accordance with the university policies.

##Course Home-page
A variety of materials will be made available on the [DM Class Home-page](http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/DMcourse/) at http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/DMcourse/, including handouts, lecture notes and assignments. Announcements may be posted between class meetings. You are responsible for being aware of whatever information is posted there. 

##Lecture Notes
Copies of **some** of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes will be available at the bottom of the class home page. Not all the lectures will have electronic notes though and the students should be prepared to take notes inside the lecture at any time.

##Announcements:
* [4-30-2014] The course project presentations will be done tomorrow at the time of the final exam (because there is no final exam). They will be done from 3:30pm to 6:30pm with 15 minutes per group in Geog/Geol room 200B. It will be a status report, giving a brief introduction, a summary of what was done and what remains to be done and if you have any questions to me or the class (especially if you are stuck or need help with some issue).
* [4-30-2014] The course project reports are due on Friday, 5-9-2014 in my office (Boyd room 219B) by 6pm. For the project report format, please write it as a conference paper of about 8 two-column pages or 12 single-column pages (there is no restriction on size though). You should include a title, an abstract, an introduction, a mention of related work if any, a description of your experiments and results and a conclusion. In the introduction or elsewhere in the paper you should describe the domain that you applied your Data Mining technique(s) to, in enough detail for the reader to appreciate the significance and difficulty of the problem. Please bring a hard copy to my office (I will be at my office from 3pm to 6pm) or leave it in my mailbox in the CS department or the AI institute any time before 6pm. I shall collect all reports and leave at 6pm. Please also include your email addresses as well as the URLs of any demo/supporting web pages. There is a slight chance that I might contact you soon after the submission deadline (within 48 hours) requesting codes, clarifications or more data.
* [4-16-2014] The second midterm will be on Thursday 4-24-2014. It will focus on the topics discussed in the course that were not covered by the first midterm. It will be open book and notes but the use of laptops or phones will not be allowed. Please bring your text book and a calculator to the exam. You should also bring your own lecture notes and all handouts.
* [4-10-2014] Homework 5 is posted below and due next Thursday [4-17-2014].
* [4-3-2014] Our class has moved permanently to room 200B due to renovations..
* [3-19-2014] As announced in class some very nice data sets and competitions can be found on www.kaggle.com/competitions. Those would make for very nice course projects.
* [2-27-2014] The first midterm will be on Thursday 3-6-2014. It will cover all the topics discussed in the course till today's lecture. It will be open book and notes but the use of laptops or phones will not be allowed. Please bring your text book to the exam. You should also bring your own lecture notes and all handouts.
