<H2>Objectives:</H2> 

The course aims to provide students with a broad introduction to the
field of Data Mining and related areas and to teach students how to
apply these methods to solve problems in complex domains.

The course is appropriate both for students preparing for research in
Data Mining and Machine Learning, as well as Bioinformatics, Science
and Engineering students who want to apply Data Mining techniques to
solve problems in their fields of study.


<H2>Recommended Background:</H2> 

CSCI 2720 Data Structures. Familiarity with basic computer algorithms
and data structures. Familiarity with the Java programming language is
recommended but not required.


<H2>Topics to be Covered:</H2> 

<li>Part I: Data Mining techniques: Selected from: Association and
Classification Rule Mining, Linear Models, Decision Trees and Random
Forests, Neural Network approaches, Support Vector Machines, Bayesian
Learning, Instance-based Learning, Pre-processing and Feature
Selection, Performance evaluation, Ensemble Learning and clustering.

<li>Part II: Data Mining applications: Selected from: Bioinformatics,
Biomedical/Physical/Chemical modeling, medical diagnosis, text/web
mining, pattern recognition and/or other contemporary applications.


<H2>Expected Work:</H2> 

Reading; assignments (include running experiments using the Weka
package); paper presentation, two midterms; and term project (may
require programming or running existing packages) and paper. <strong>
Unless otherwise announced by the instructor, all assignments and all
exams must be done entirely on your own.</strong>

<H2>Academic Honesty and Integrity:</H2> 

All academic work must meet the standards contained in <A
HREF="http://www.uga.edu/honesty/ahpd/culture_honesty.htm">
"A Culture of Honesty."</A> Students are responsible for informing
themselves about those standards before performing any academic
work. The penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance
is not an acceptable defense.

<H2>Grading Policy:</H2> 

<li>Assignments: 20% (Programs, homeworks, attendance, paper presentation)
<li>Midterm Examinations: 40%   
<li>Term Project: 40% (includes term paper and presentation)
<br>

Students may work on their term projects in groups of up to
<strong>three</strong> students each. The above distribution is only
tentative and may change later. The instructor will announce any
changes.

<H2>Assignment Submission Policy</H2> 

Assignments must be turned in by the assigned deadline. Late
assignments will not be accepted. Rare exceptions may be made by the
instructor only under extenuating circumstances and in accordance with
the university policies.

<H2>Course Home-page</H2> 

A variety of materials will be made available on the DM Class
Home-page at <A HREF="http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/DMcourse/">
http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/DMcourse/</a>, including handouts,
lecture notes and assignments. Announcements may be posted between
class meetings.  You are responsible for being aware of whatever
information is posted there.

<H2>Lecture Notes</H2>

Copies of <strong>some</strong> of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes will be
available at the bottom of the class home page. Not all the lectures
will have electronic notes though and the students should be prepared
to take notes inside the lecture at any time.

<H2>Announcements:</H2>

<li> [4-30-2014] The course project presentations will be done
tomorrow at the time of the final exam (because there is no final
exam). They will be done from 3:30pm to 6:30pm with 15 minutes per
group in Geog/Geol room 200B. It will be a status report, giving a
brief introduction, a summary of what was done and what remains to be
done and if you have any questions to me or the class (especially if
you are stuck or need help with some issue).

<li> [4-30-2014] The course project reports are due on Friday,
5-9-2014 in my office (Boyd room 219B) by 6pm. For the project report
format, please write it as a conference paper of about 8 two-column
pages or 12 single-column pages (there is no restriction on size
though). You should include a title, an abstract, an introduction, a
mention of related work if any, a description of your experiments and
results and a conclusion. In the introduction or elsewhere in the
paper you should describe the domain that you applied your Data Mining
technique(s) to, in enough detail for the reader to appreciate the
significance and difficulty of the problem. Please bring a hard copy
to my office (I will be at my office from 3pm to 6pm) or leave it in
my mailbox in the CS department or the AI institute any time before
6pm. I shall collect all reports and leave at 6pm. Please also include
your email addresses as well as the URLs of any demo/supporting web
pages. There is a slight chance that I might contact you soon after
the submission deadline (within 48 hours) requesting codes,
clarifications or more data.

<li> [4-16-2014] The second midterm will be on Thursday 4-24-2014. It
will focus on the topics discussed in the course that were not covered
by the first midterm. It will be open book and notes but the use of
laptops or phones will not be allowed. Please bring your text book and
a calculator to the exam. You should also bring your own lecture notes
and all handouts.

<li> [4-10-2014] Homework 5 is posted below and due next Thursday
[4-17-2014].

<li> [4-3-2014] Our class has moved permanently to room 200B due to
renovations..

<li> [3-19-2014] As announced in class some very nice data sets and
competitions can be found on www.kaggle.com/competitions. Those would
make for very nice course projects.

<li> [2-27-2014] The first midterm will be on Thursday 3-6-2014. It
will cover all the topics discussed in the course till today's
lecture. It will be open book and notes but the use of laptops or
phones will not be allowed. Please bring your text book to the
exam. You should also bring your own lecture notes and all handouts.
