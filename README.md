##Objectives:
The course aims to provide students with a broad introduction to the field of Data Mining and related areas and to teach students how to apply these methods to solve problems in complex domains. The course is appropriate both for students preparing for research in Data Mining and Machine Learning, as well as Bioinformatics, Science and Engineering students who want to apply Data Mining techniques to solve problems in their fields of study.

##Recommended Background:
CSCI 2720 Data Structures. Familiarity with basic computer algorithms and data structures. Familiarity with the Java programming language is recommended but not required.

##Topics to be Covered:
Part I: Data Mining techniques: Selected from: Association and Classification Rule Mining, Linear Models, Decision Trees and Random Forests, Neural Network approaches, Support Vector Machines, Bayesian Learning, Instance-based Learning, Pre-processing and Feature Selection, Performance evaluation, Ensemble Learning and clustering.
Part II: Data Mining applications: Selected from: Bioinformatics, Biomedical/Physical/Chemical modeling, medical diagnosis, text/web mining, pattern recognition and/or other contemporary applications.

##Expected Work:
Reading; assignments (include running experiments using the Weka package); paper presentation, two midterms; and term project (may require programming or running existing packages) and paper. **Unless otherwise announced by the instructor, all assignments and all exams must be done entirely on your own.**

##Academic Honesty and Integrity:
All academic work must meet the standards contained in ["A Culture of Honesty."](http://www.uga.edu/honesty/ahpd/culture_honesty.htm) Students are responsible for informing themselves about those standards before performing any academic work. The penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance is not an acceptable defense.

##Grading Policy:
Assignments: 20% (Programs, homeworks, attendance, paper presentation)  
Midterm Examinations: 40%  
Term Project: 40% (includes term paper and presentation)  
Students may work on their term projects in groups of up to **three** students each. The above distribution is only tentative and may change later. The instructor will announce any changes. 

##Assignment Submission Policy
Assignments must be turned in by the assigned deadline. Late assignments will not be accepted. Rare exceptions may be made by the instructor only under extenuating circumstances and in accordance with the university policies.

##Course Home-page
A variety of materials will be made available on the [DM Class Home-page](http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/DMcourse/) at http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/DMcourse/, including handouts, lecture notes and assignments. Announcements may be posted between class meetings. You are responsible for being aware of whatever information is posted there. 

##Lecture Notes
Copies of **some** of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes will be available at the bottom of the class home page. Not all the lectures will have electronic notes though and the students should be prepared to take notes inside the lecture at any time.
